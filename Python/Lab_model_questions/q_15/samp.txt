The Cherenkov effect occurs when a particle carrying an electric charge 
travels through a transparent medium like water or air. If the particle travels 
faster than light in this medium, its passage causes a brief flash of light, 
a Cherenkov light.
The effect is named after the Soviet physicist Pavel Alekseyevich
Cherenkov (1904-1990) who discovered the phenomenon and obtained the Nobel
Prize in Physics for his discovery in 1958.
